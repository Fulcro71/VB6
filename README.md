**Diagramma del momento** is a little utility that creates bending moment diagram and traslated diagram for reinforced concrete rods.
Basically is a 2Â° degree equation solver starting from coefficient, in which zeroes are the secant points of the parabolic diagram of the bending moment in the X-axis.
Starting from these, the program creates the DXF file, in which can be included the traslated diagram necessary for measuring reinforcement bar length.
