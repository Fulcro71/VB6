**Roland D50 Bank/Patch Editor** (created in 2008)

This software is intended for loading, modifying and sending patches via MIDI to the worldwide famous Roland D50 synthesizer.
This synthesizer has 2 types of expansion cards: patch expansion and waveform expansion. Either patch and wave expansions are became a lot expensive because Roland D50, even being a late '80 instrument, is still one of the more wanted instrument of the digital era.
Such cards are very rare, and thus expensive. Roland released the binary files of the patch expansion, that can be send to the instrument via MIDI (a MIDI interface is required).
The main feature of this software is that **a single patch can be send to the internal memory of the D50**.

Every patch can be modified (obvoiusly the good knowledge of the MIDI Implementation Chart is required) byte to byte, the sysEx instruction can be rebuild anche the CRC byte is automatically calculated to be validated by the D50.
